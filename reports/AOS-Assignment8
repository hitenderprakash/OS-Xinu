Assignment 8:

Part 1:
We wrote a UDP client program "UDPLinuxClient.c"
We run "udpeserver" on xinu and run the above program on Linux as ./UDPLinuxClient.out 192.168.1.101 7
It sends the message to xinu and receive a reply


Part2: Delete stale ARP Cache
We changed the arpentry struct to add new variable "recordTime" which is assigned a clock alue when arp cache is written
Whenever, arp_resolve is called, it checks if the resolved arp entries are stale (more than 5 minute life)
arp_alloc before checks all the arp cache enteries and delete if any entry is old

Part3:
We modified the future program that now producer sends the value using udp messege and consumer receives it from there
run program with "future -n" for uing network future and use "future -f" to run the old future
